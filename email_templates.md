## Usage in Notification System

These templates should be integrated into the notification service (`service/notification_service.go`) and used when:

1. **Template 1**: Complaint is assigned to a department/officer
2. **Template 2**: Complaint escalates due to SLA breach
3. **Template 3**: Complaint status changes to "resolved" or "closed"

The notification service should replace placeholders with actual values from the complaint and department data before sending emails.
